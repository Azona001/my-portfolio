                    <p>
                         I'm a frontend developer with a background in animation and a recent
          graduate of Simplilearn's Full-Stack Development Bootcamp. I enjoy
          building responsive, accessible, and visually engaging websites. After
          years of bringing stories to life through animation, I now bring that
          creative energy into writing clean, user-friendly code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, I'm focused on improving my JavaScript skills, exploring modern frameworks, and contributing to real-world projects.
